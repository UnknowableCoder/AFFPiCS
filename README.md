# AFFPiCS
Anonymous Flexible Framework for Particle-in-Cell Simulation

# Requirements

Requires [G24Lib](https://github.com/UnknowableCoder/G24Lib), [Simbpolic](https://github.com/UnknowableCoder/Simbpolic) and [Mad<ro Trid<s](https://github.com/UnknowableCoder/MackroTricks).

# Compiling

Simply `#include "everything.h"` to have the whole framework and all currently implemented options available, else, be more careful and include only the headers with the desired features.

# Documentation

TBD

# Acknowledgements

The author must thank all those family members who kindly did not complain too much about the strange sleeping schedules during the development of this library (concurrent with other work...).
